    <h1>Andrew Weathers</h1>

    <!--#include virtual="/logo.html" -->

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Andrew Weathers (1988) is a composer and improviser based in the southern Front Range region of Colorado. His work is equally concerned with the disjunction of duration and place, as well as improvisation’s prospect as a vessel of discovery and collective practice. His projects and performances span the idioms of field recording, prepared guitar, surrealist soundscape, and minimalist composition rooted in repetition and drone. Apart from his longtime commitment to collaboration alongside a wide swath of figures inhabiting the sonic underground, Weathers is founder and operator of Full Spectrum Records, which has continued to release the works of sundry sound artists and experimental musicians since its inception in 2008 in his home state of North Carolina. On top of frequent credits as a mixing and mastering engineer, he has also produced various projects for Other Minds Records and Rural Situationism.</p>
