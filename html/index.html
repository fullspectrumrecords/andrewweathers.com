    <h1>Andrew Weathers</h1>

    {{include "/logo.html" }}

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Andrew Weathers (1988) is a composer, improviser, and intermedia artist based in the Front Range region of Colorado. His work is equally concerned with the disjunction of duration and place, as well as improvisation’s prospect as a vessel of discovery and collective practice. His projects and performances span the idioms of field recording, prepared guitar, surrealist soundscape, and minimalist composition rooted in repetition and drone. Apart from his longtime commitment to collaboration alongside a wide swath of figures inhabiting the sonic underground, Weathers was also founder and operator of Full Spectrum Records. Founded in his home state of North Carolina in 2008, the label released the works of sundry sound artists and experimental musicians, eventually moving its operations to the Llano Estacado region of northwestern Texas before reaching a conscious conclusion in 2024. On top of frequent credits as a mixing and mastering engineer, he has also produced various projects for Other Minds Records and Rural Situationism.
