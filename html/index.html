    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Andrew Weathers (b.1988) is a composer and improviser originally from Chapel Hill, NC and currently 
    based in Littlefield, TX. His work engages with notions of place, tradition, repetition, and spirit. 
    Weathers studied composition at UNC-Greensboro and electronic music at Mills College in Oakland, CA.</p>

    <p>A consistent presence in the underground music scene over the past decade, Weathers&rsquo; work 
    covers a wide spectrum from solo acoustic guitar to electronic noise. He also performs and records 
    regularly with Tethers, Real Life Rock &amp; Roll Band, Tender Crust, Wind Tide, Satin Spar, Llano Estacado Monad 
    Band and in long-running collaborations with Seth Chrisman and tanner menard, among others. In addition 
    to his busy performing schedule, Weathers operates the Full Spectrum and Other Minds record labels, curates 
    the Longitudes music series at CO-OPt Research + Projects in Lubbock, TX and works as a freelance mixing 
    and mastering engineer.</p>
